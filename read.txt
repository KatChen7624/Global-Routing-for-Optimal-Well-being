For this program to work as intended python3 needs to be installed with the requests library.

if you don't have python installed download the latest version
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Make sure your package manager (pip) is up to date.
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

Then we need to make sure you have the request library
python3 -m pip install requests
